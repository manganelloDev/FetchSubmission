## FetchSubmission
Hello, my name is Ryan Manganello. I have over 2 years of Android devlopement experice from my time at General Motors. During my time at GM, my scrum and I developed various android applications that displayed on the radio screens of Chevy, Buick, GMC, and Cadillac vehicles. The apps I developed covered a wide variety of usecases. Some involved extensive usages of external APIs and SDKs, while others required significant interfacing with GM internal software that was ran on various modules throughout the vehicles.
